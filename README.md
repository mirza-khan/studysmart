A way to practice studying for CAIES


We will have a function that takes you from a past paper question number (e.g. Math/P1/Q2/2018/NOV) to the actual question. This is how questions will be stored. The system will track which questions you get correct and which you don't, and then use spaced repitition to help you master questions like them. Questions will be grouped (eventually) by a neural network trained to classify question types by looking at keywords. The current implementation will not include this neural network.
